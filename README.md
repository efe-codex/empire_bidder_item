## Installation

### 0. Download Files and Install Dependencies

Download the project files, install Python, and then install the required modules as described in [HOW TO INSTALL](HOWTOINSTALL.md).

## Enter Price Data

### 1. Edit Item Prices

Open `items_editor.py` to edit the `items.json` file. Add items by full name like:

## Configure Settings

### 2. Update Configuration

Edit the `config.json` file to match your desired settings. Below is a sample configuration:

```json
{
    "empireapi": "",              // Your API key
    "domain": "csgoempire.tv",    // Use .com or another domain
    "local_excel": false,         // Track bought items locally (ensure Excel is closed)
    "online_excel": false,        // Use online Excel tracking
    "sheet_file_name": "",
    "sheet_id": "",
    "bid_timer": 3.5              // Time between bids
}
```

## Run the Client

### 3. Start Bidding

Once you've updated the `config.json`, run the client to start bidding.

---

## How It Works

You enter the item names and their maximum prices. The bot will bid on these items until the specified price is reached.
